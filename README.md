<h4> WorkoutBook</h4>

<p>This is a simple Sinatra-active_record application that works as an actual blog. It has a corneal gem to build most of the files and it is based on MVC, RESTful routes and CRUD.</p>

<p>In the WorkoutBook the user can create (sign up) their profile page, which they can edit whenever they would like. If they already signed up they can just log in with their email and password. All users should create posts with pictures related to workout, whether they are working out or showing the progress of their clients. They can also edit their posts as well as delete them. They are also able to see/read other people's posts and profiles. Whenever users are done they can log out.</p>
